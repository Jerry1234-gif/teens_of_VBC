        <h1>Happy New Year to the Beloved Teenagers of Victory Baptist Church!</h1>

        <p>Dear cherished Teens,</p>

        <p>As we stand at the threshold of a brand new year, I want to pour out my heartfelt wishes for a truly joyous and blessed 2026, filled with God's endless grace, personal growth, and unbreakable bonds of friendship.</p>

        <p>From the bottom of my heart, I thank you for always being there for me—lifting my spirit through your unwavering faith, supporting me in our shared journeys physically, and in countless other ways that have touched my soul deeply and made me feel truly connected.</p>

        <p>A profound thanks to our incredible Coordinator and Assistant Coordinator, whose selfless dedication and wise guidance have been a beacon of light for us all. To every leader, your tireless support, encouragement, and leadership have inspired us beyond words. And to all my dear, lovable members—thank you so very much for your warmth, energy, and love that make our group so special.</p>

        <p>The joyful fun times we've shared, the powerful prayers that have moved our hearts, the meaningful meetings that have sparked our minds, and the delicious meals enjoyed together—these have been the most treasured and unforgettable moments of my life, weaving a tapestry of memories that I'll cherish forever.</p>

        <p>As we welcome 2026 with open arms, let's unite in prayer for a fresh surge of zeal and passion, propelling our Teens Fellowship to soaring new levels, where we can impact more lives, deepen our faith, and shine brighter for God's glory.</p>

        <p class="signature">With deepest love and eternal gratitude,<br>~Jere</p>
